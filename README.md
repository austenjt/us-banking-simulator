# Versions

## v1

Version one has some problems:

1. Not keeping track of t-bill counts when individuals buy them
2. Still missing feature:  banks selling loan to each other for reserves
3. Needs an additional bank branch in simulation
4. Needs 3 bank customers on the simulation

## v2

Version has the following issues I want to improve on next version:

1. Support for some Open Market Operations
2. Display "total national debt" at the top.  Need to figure out how to calculate this.
